# Ali Walton, Loops Notes in Python

# 1. What is a loop?
    # A section of code that is going to repeat.

# 2. What are the two types of loops?
    # While loop
x = 0
while x < 10:
    print("Hello", x)
    x +=1

    #For loop
nums = [3,5,7,2,8]
for num in nums:
    print(num)

# 3. What is iteration
    # The act of repeating something.

# 4. What are lists? 
    # A bunch of values in the same variable

siblings = ["Alex", "Katie", "Andrew", "Vienna", "Tori", "Treyson", "Jeff", "Hailey"]
#print one item from the list
print(siblings[3])
#change an item in a list
siblings[7] = "Jake"
#remove an item from the list
#siblings.pop(5)

# 5. How do you make lists in python? 
    #[]around the list with a comma between each item in the list
    # list items must be proper data types

# 6. How do you make for loops in python? 
    #

#proper list printing with a for loop
num = 1
for sibling in siblings:
    print(f"{num}. {sibling}, LaRose")
    num +=1
#using range instead of a list
for num in range(1,11, 2):
    print(num)

# 7. How do you make while loops in python?
import random

num = 1
rand = random.randint(1,20)
while num < 21:
    if num == rand:
        print(f"Goose!")
        break #Tells the loop to be done
    else:
        print("Duck")
    # print(num)
    num +=1


# continue tells the loop to stop that iteration and start again
